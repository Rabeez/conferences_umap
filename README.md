# conferences_umap

Inspired by [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mvemov/oc_relationship_of_top_computer_science/) by u/wuyongzheng I decided to make my own version.

I added the conference names and groups myself (with help from annotations from original post). 

I think the cosine similarity version looks much better with tighter clusters compared to the euclidean version. Still the actual clusters and relative positions are basically same in both versions (compare the flipped version of euclidean with cosine). 
- Programming languages and software engineering are together
- All the AI/ML stuff inclusing applications (CV, NLP, Robotics) are together. The Data Manegement/Enginnering conferences are here as well. The Computational biology one also sneaked in here. I'm not sure about WWW but since I'm not familiar with the conference I can't say much.
- VR is (imo) correctly placed in the HCI cluster
- Mobile systems are (again imo) correctly directly between HCI and Networks
- Cryptography and Security are together
- Almost all Networks, Systems and Embedded conferences are together
- HPC and Architecture are also together. Curiously DAC is here too as well as the CAD conference.
